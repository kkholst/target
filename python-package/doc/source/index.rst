Targeted inference in python
===============================

``targeted`` provides a number of methods for semi-parametric
estimation.  The library also contains implementations of various
parametric models (including different discrete choice models) and
model diagnostics tools.

Relevant models includes binary regression models with binary exposure
and with nuisance models defined by additional covariates. Models for
the relative risk and risk differences where examined by
[Richardson_2018]_. Various missing data estimators and causal
inference models [Tsiatis_2006]_ also fits into this framework.

.. note:: This document is still very much work in progress.
